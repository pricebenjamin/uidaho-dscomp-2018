# UI Data Science Competition

For the machine learning track of the University of Idaho's inagural 
Data Science competition, students were tasked with constructing a neural 
network that could grade handwritten arithmetic problems. These handwritten 
problems took one of four possible forms:

* `a + b = c`,
* `a - b = c`,
* `a = b + c`, or
* `a = b - c`.

This repository contains the scripts which trained the first place network. 

## Work in progress

This README will eventually contain a summary of my experiences as a 
participant in this competition, as well as a thorough description of the 
network design.
